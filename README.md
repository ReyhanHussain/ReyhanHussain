* Master fundamental data structures and algorithms in C++
* Contribute meaningfully to at least one open-source project
* Build a network of like-minded developers and mentors
* Create a sophisticated electronics project that incorporates software elements

### Interests Beyond Tech

When I'm not coding or soldering components, I enjoy:
* Watching Documentaries.
* Reading books on technology and      innovation.
*playing video games
### Let's Connect

I'm always open to collaboration, mentorship, or just a good conversation about technology.
